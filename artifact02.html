                        <p>The concept of the GEM Convention landing page was to create a digital space that would capture the excitement and anticipation of the event. We aimed to design a user-friendly platform where attendees could easily navigate and find relevant information about the convention. The brainstorming phase focused on identifying key elements that would enhance the user experience and promote interaction.</p>

                        <p>A significant feature of this project is the interactive countdown timer. The timer was implemented using JavaScript to create a dynamic, real-time countdown to the start of the GEM Convention. This feature adds a sense of urgency and excitement for the event, encouraging users to register or purchase tickets.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <p>One of the challenges I faced during the development of this project was figuring out whether to use CSS Flexbox or Grid for different elements on the page. Both of these CSS layout modules are powerful tools for aligning and distributing space among items in a container, but they each have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, and it is particularly well suited for distribution of space along a single column or row. It is great for aligning items and handling the 'flexible box' layout where the size of the box can adjust to fill the available space. However, when it comes to building more complex layouts, it can become tricky.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model that can handle both columns and rows, making it ideal for creating complex layouts. It was specifically designed for this purpose, so it has powerful features that make it easier to create complex responsive layouts. But, it can be overkill for simpler, one-dimensional layouts.</p>
                        <p>In my project, I had to carefully analyze each layout requirement and decide whether Flexbox or Grid was the better tool for the job. This often involved some trial and error, as I had to experiment with both techniques to see which one produced the desired result. It was a challenging but rewarding process, as it deepened my understanding of these powerful CSS tools and improved my ability to make effective layout decisions.</p>

                        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>One of the key takeaways from this project was the importance of focusing on functionality over aesthetics during the development process. While the design prototypes in Figma were visually appealing, they did not translate well to the live website. This was a lesson in the difference between design and development, and the challenges that can arise when a design is not fully optimized for the web.</p>
                        <p>However, rather than dwelling on the discrepancies between the design and the live site, I decided to focus on building the website exactly as it appeared in the Figma prototypes. My goal was not to create a perfect replica of the design, but to demonstrate my capability to build a website that mirrored the designer's vision. This decision allowed me to test my skills and ensure that I could accurately implement the design in code.</p>
                        <p>While this approach might not always result in the most visually pleasing website, it did provide me with valuable experience in understanding the limitations of design prototypes and the importance of considering user experience during the development process. This experience has deepened my understanding of the relationship between design and development, and has given me a new perspective on how to approach future projects.</p>
